# AnchoAPI — Documentation

Welcome to the official AnchoAPI documentation.

AnchoAPI is a modular Java library focused on providing clean abstractions for:
- command processing
- advanced data-bound objects (“items”)
- leveling logic
- storage utilities (JSON + SQL)
- reflection helpers
- builders and lightweight managers

It is designed to be framework-agnostic. While you *can* use it inside Minecraft environments, the API itself does not depend on Bukkit, Spigot, or any game-specific library.

## Philosophy

AnchoAPI follows these core principles:

### **1. Minimal boilerplate**
Code should be short, expressive, and intention-based.

### **2. Annotation-first design**
Wherever reasonable, annotations replace heavy configuration.

### **3. Clean abstractions**
APIs are designed around interfaces, not implementations.

### **4. Modularity**
Every block (commands, items, leveling, storage) can be used independently.
